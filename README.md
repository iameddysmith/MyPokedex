# MyPokedex Frontend

This is the frontend for the **MyPokedex** project, a React-based app that connects to a backend server to display, add, and manage your collection of Pokémon.

### Backend Repository

For the backend API, check out the [MyPokedex-Backend](https://github.com/iameddysmith/MyPokedex-Backend).

Link to my GitHub Pages [MyPokedex](https://iameddysmith.github.io/MyPokedex/).

The backend server is currently set up to run on `http://localhost:3001`.

## Features

- **Pokémon Display**: Browse a collection of Pokémon with options to filter by type and search by name.

## Future Additions

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in and sign up (authentication handled on the backend).
- **Add to MyPokedex**: Once logged in, users can add Pokémon to their personal collection (feature to be implemented in the backend).
